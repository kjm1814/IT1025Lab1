## Executive Summary
IT1025 is an introductary course that is required for many of the IT degrees at Cuyahoga Community College. In this course we will learn the history of computing and networking and programming concepts. Lab 1 of IT1025 is a foundational part of all that will be done in the course. It will introduce many to the platform GitHub as well as new language involving technology.

## Information System Components
1. Hardware- Disk Drives
2. Software- Application Software: iOS; Operating Software: Windows
3. Data- Phone Number 
4. People- Developers
5. Process- Business Process Management 
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
Client server architecture is the architecture of many clients that recieve service from a centralized server. The concept is that the clients are able to task the server with requests and the server responds with clear results. GitHub is an example of this because it is able to provide service to multiple clients from one server in real time.
### Cloud Computing
An on-demand service that allows for users to store, manage and process data using a network of remote servers rather than a local server or personal computer.
## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
### CPU, Input & Output
### Logic Gates 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

## Conclusion
This is an example, please delete and create your own professional summary:
Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
