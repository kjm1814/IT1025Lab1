## Executive Summary
IT1025 is an introductory course that is required for many of the IT degrees at Cuyahoga Community College. In this course, we will learn the history of computing and networking, and programming concepts. Lab 1 of IT1025 is a foundational part of all that will be done in the course. It will introduce many to the platform GitHub as well as new language involving technology.

## Information System Components
1. Hardware- Disk Drives
2. Software- Application Software: iOS; Operating Software: Windows
3. Data- Phone Number 
4. People- Developers
5. Process- Business Process Management 
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
Client-server architecture is the architecture of many clients that receive service from a centralized server. The concept is that the clients can task the server with requests and the server responds with clear results. GitHub is an example of this because it can provide service to multiple clients from one server in real-time.
### Cloud Computing
An on-demand service that allows for users to store, manage and process data using a network of remote servers rather than a local server or personal computer.
## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the time you wait for a sector to be accessible by your head after a completed seek. Transfer rate is the speed that data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Solid State(SSD) offers better stability than a hard drive due to it having no moving parts and no degradation of performance when data is fragmented. SSD also addresses most of the structural problems inherent to a hard disk thus allowing for there to be no latency. 
#### Random Access Memory
Due to RAM being temporary storage, it causes the CPU to send data back to RAM and eventually use Hard Drive space. Thus, making the computer run slower. If you increase RAM, it eliminates the extra step and allows the computer to run faster. 
### ALU and the Control Unit
The arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU) is a component of the Control Unit. ALU performs all of the Mathematical operations inside of the CPU. As the Control Unit receives orders from RAM, it sends the instruction to the ALU.
### CPU, Input & Output
1. Input- Card or cash payment at pump or service counter; selection of gasoline(regular, premium, or diesel) with the press of a button.
2. CPU- Reacts to gasoline selection. Activates correct valves to release gasoline.
3. Output- Pump releases the selected gasoline
### Logic Gates 
The truth table shows the output you get for every possible input. 
AND logic gate works when both inputs are on. OR logic gates work if either input is switched on. 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE) is an association dedicated to advancing innovation & technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. It is the world's largest technical society. 
The code of ethics for computing has 8 principles. The principles talk about the responsibility of the software engineers to make sure they are not only innovative but they are well rounded and ethical individuals. 
## Conclusion
In Lab 1, I learned about the platform GitHub. I was familiar with certain parts of the editing due to Tumblr having themes you can edit. So learning how to use GitHub wasn't as steep of a learning curve. I found the lab to very engaging from the start. The readings were a tad overwhelming when it came to making sure I comprehended the terms and could apply them. I feel with more practice of application, I'll get more comfortable.
