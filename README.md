## Executive Summary
IT1025 is an introductary course that is required for many of the IT degrees at Cuyahoga Community College. In this course we will learn the history of computing and networking and programming concepts. Lab 1 of IT1025 is a foundational part of all that will be done in the course. It will introduce many to the platform GitHub as well as new language involving technology.

## Information System Components
1. Hardware- Disk Drives
2. Software- Application Software: iOS; Operating Software: Windows
3. Data- Phone Number 
4. People- Developers
5. Process- Business Process Management 
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
Client server architecture is the architecture of many clients that recieve service from a centralized server. The concept is that the clients are able to task the server with requests and the server responds with clear results. GitHub is an example of this because it is able to provide service to multiple clients from one server in real time.
### Cloud Computing
An on-demand service that allows for users to store, manage and process data using a network of remote servers rather than a local server or personal computer.
## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the time you wait for a sector to be accessible by your head after a completed seek. Transfer rate is the speed that data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Solid State(SSD) offers better stability than a hard drive due to it having no moving parts and no degredation of performance when data is fragmented. SSD also addresses most of the structural problems inherent to a hard disk thus allowing for there to be no latency. 
#### Random Access Memory
Due to RAM being temporary storage, it causes the CPU to send data back to RAM and eventually use Hard Drive space. Thus, making the computer run slower. If you increase RAM, it eliminates the extra step and allows the computer to run faster. 
### ALU and the Control Unit
Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU) is a component of the Control Unit. ALU performs all of the Mathematical operations inside of the CPU. As the Control Unit receives ordrs from RAM, it send the instruction to the ALU.
### CPU, Input & Output
1. Input- Card or cash payment at pump or service counter; selection of gasoline(regular, premium or diesel) with the press of a button.
2. CPU- Reacts to gasoline selection. Activates correct valves to release gasoline.
3. Output- Pump releases the selected gasoline
### Logic Gates 

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

## Conclusion
This is an example, please delete and create your own professional summary:
Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
